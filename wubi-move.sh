#!/bin/bash
# Moves an Ubuntu install (normal or a loopinstallation e.g. Wubi) 
# to a dedicated partition install. 
# Migration from a Wubi root.disk is supported as well.
# 
# If you have grub legacy installed, it will remove it on the 
# target (only) and replace it with grub2.
#
# While every effort has been made to ensure the script works as
# intended and is bug free, please note you use it AT YOUR OWN RISK.
# Please BACKUP any important data prior to running.
#
# Credits:
# Much of the script's fundamentals are based on the work of
# other people e.g. the original wubi migration script and lupin:

Usage: sudo bash $0 [OPTION] target_partition [swap_partition]
       e.g. sudo bash $0 /dev/sda5 /dev/sda6

Migrate an ubuntu install (wubi or normal) to partition
  -h, --help              print this message and exit
  -v, --version           print the version information and exit
  --notes                 print the Assumptions and Notes, and exit
  --no-bootloader         do not install the grub2 bootloader
  --shared-swap           share swap partition with an existing install

EOF
} 
assumptions_notes () 
{
    cat <<EOF
Assumptions: 
  1. The script will detect automatically whether the current install
     to be migrated is a Wubi or normal install. 
  2. If you are running the script from a live CD/USB then the 
     --root-disk= option is required. The grub2 bootloader must be
     installed when using this option.
  3. The grub2 bootloader will be installed to /dev/sdX where /dev/sdXY
     is the target partition, unless --no-bootloader is specified.
     You will still be prompted whether to install the grub bootloader 
     unless option -y or --assume-yes is supplied.
  4. If the install being migrated contains grub-legacy it will be 
     replaced with Grub2 (only on the migrated install). You are not 
     required to install the Grub2 bootloader, however, if you choose
     not to then you will have to manually modify the menu.lst to boot
     the migrated install.
     NOTE: the grub2 installation takes control and requires user input
     on releases 9.10 and greater. It will also prompt for the bootloader
     install drive/partition.
  5. The target partition file system will be formatted as ext4 (default) 
     or ext3 if detected on the install being migrated.
  6. An install with separate /home, /boot, or /usr partitions or virtual
     disks will be merged when it is migrated onto the single target 
     partition and fstab modified accordingly.

Notes:
  If you install the grub bootloader, then the grub menu from your migrated
  install will be presented at boot - not the windows menu (for Wubi installs.)
  If you do not install the bootloader, then you will still be able to 
  boot the migrated install from the current install's Grub menu, unless your
  current install uses grub legacy.
  For Wubi users, make sure you install bootloader before uninstalling Wubi. 

  To install the bootloader manually, boot your new installation and run: 
       sudo grub-install /dev/sdX 
  (where X is the drive you boot from e.g. /dev/sda)

Recommended:
  Run "sudo update-grub" on the migrated install after booting the first time
